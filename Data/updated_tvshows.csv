When Anne Boleyn plays much harder to get than any woman ever has, Henry begins to search for a way out of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, so that he can make Anne his wife. Needing a divorce, Henry turns to Wolsey, who promises to help him create waves of backlash from the church, as well as the Spanish Habsburg dynasty and its overseas empire.

Simon Cooper, Jay Cartwright and Neil Sutherland have been friends for some time. Insecure Simon's main quest in life is to get long time friend, Carli D'Amato, to be his girlfriend. Jay is the big talker whose stories, especially about his sexual conquests, are more fantasy than reality. And slightly dim-witted Neil is generally two steps behind everyone else in comprehension of life, and who is always defending his father from beliefs that he's a closet homosexual. Into the group comes its fourth member, Will McKenzie, who met them when he transferred into their school, Rudge Park Comprehensive, at the start of sixth form, as Will's newly divorced mum could no longer afford his private school tuition.

He has just returned from military service and is about to marry the girl of his dreams, the stunning Eysan. His two best friends, Cengiz and Ali are like brothers to him, and he trusts them with all his heart. Everything seems perfect, as his whole life lies in front of him. The drama starts when the police storm into Omer's bedroom when he is still sleeping. He gets arrested for a murder and robbery at the casino the night before. Omer gets imprisoned for the crime - his life is shattered, friends and fiancé disappear. Instead, one single question is on his mind for the next ten years: Why? It is obvious that Omer has been set up, but could such a terrible crime really have been planned by his two best friends and fiancé Eysan? Omer gets eventually declared dead in prison, but the death is a cover up for the revenge to come. After plastic surgery Omer returns as Ezel, with only one mission in life - to find an explanation, and to take everything away from those who once destroyed his life. But first, he has to kill the constant, incorrigible, and endless love he still carries for the girl of his dreams, Eysan. One by one, the pieces fall in place in a very thrilling story. Omer's two best friends Ali and Cengiz were convinced to rob the casino by the mafioso Serdar Tezcan , who also happens to be Omer's girlfriend Eysan's father. Serdar created the whole plan. He needed four people for a successful robbery. The first, Cengiz would be the mole who was working in the casino and who would therefore gain access. The second, Ali would be the ruthless killer who has no problem committing murder if needed. The third, Eysan would be the skilled con-woman who would manipulate the characters. Finally, Omer would be blamed for the robbery by way of implanting false evidence, and therefore misleading the police and causing them to cease all other investigations. Eysan would later testify in court in order to re-establish the evidence and accusations, thus cementing her betrayal. The plan worked successfully and while all 4 got away with millions of dollars' worth of money, Omer went to jail the day after he proposed to Eysan. In 2006, Omer, who had a full plastic surgery, and changed his name to Ezel Bayraktar (""eternity"" in Turkish), returns to get his revenge, unknown to his previous friends, Eysan and Cengiz (who are now married with a son), and Ali (who is head of security at Cengiz's hotel) The once simple boy becomes a man exceptionally skilled at gambling, reading people, fighting, and has considerably high class in society.

293,Wentworth,2013,18+,8.6,,1,0,0,0,1,NA,"Crime,Drama",Australia,English,45,NA,"Fans of the iconic Prisoner Cell Block H series, which pushed boundaries over three decades ago and still boasts a loyal following worldwide today, will remember Bea Smith as gutsy and fearless, ruling Wentworth Correctional Centre with an iron fist. But who was Bea Smith before prison? How did a wife and mother from the suburbs become a top dog without rival? Wentworth Prison is a dynamic, often confronting, drama series that begins with Bea's early days in prison. Set in the present day, it is a modern adaptation of Prisoner Cell Block H that contemporises legendary characters and their stories for today's audience. This series takes the viewer inside to an uncompromising environment that explores the politics of women in a world without men, and how such a threatening experience both challenges and often changes those confined and working behind the razor wire. The audience will be introduced to Bea all over again and meet her allies and enemies in the form of iconic inmates: Doreen Anderson, Liz Birdsworth and Franky Doyle, and there are new faces such as Jacs Holt, the ruthless matriarch of a crime family who now reigns over Wentworth. Favourite offices will also return. Meg Jackson carries a shameful secret; Vera Bennett, the well-meaning officer who discovers everyone has a price; Erica Davidson, the crusading Lawyer and Matthew Fletcher who believes in retribution rather than rehabilitation. And a new face, Meg's husband Will Jackson, whose past still haunts him. Each episode explores an individual character's back story, providing an insight to what makes them tick and the circumstances that led them to Wentworth. In doing so we discover that the difference between an inmate and an officer is sometimes simply geography, because they're all prisoners in surprisingly different ways. Like the original Prisoner Cell Block H, Wentworth Prison is, at its heart, a series about survival, a character drama featuring women living in a pressure cooker environment. Despite the rivalries and power struggles, this family of misfits and rebels are forced to forge unlikely friendships and allegiances if they want to survive their time inside.",8.6,"Kate Atkinson,Katrina Milosevic,Robbie Magasiva,Jacqueline Brennan,Celia Ireland,Pamela Rabe,Kate Jenkinson,Bernard Curry,Lauri McLennan,Nicole da Silva,Lucia Brancatisano,Shareena Clanton,Eloise Wright,Danielle Cormack,Tammy Macintosh,Rarriwuy Hick,Susie Porter,Katherine Grinlaw,Leah Purcell,Ra Chapman,Socratis Otto,Aaron Jeffery,Libby Tanner,Sally-Anne Upton,Bessie Holland,David de Lautour,Sigrid Thornton,Charli Tjoe,Maddy Jevic,Georgia Chara,Kate Box,Zoe Terakes,Sophia Katos,Jane Hall,Maggie Naouri,Artemis Ioannides,Sarah Hallam,Vivienne Awosoga,Martin Sacks,Carly Baker,P.J.

As they investigate further the mystery about the curse of Crystal Cove, they discover that a creature known as ""The Freak of Crystal Cove"" threatens and stalks anyone who comes near the haunted treasure. They uncover the Freak's true identity to be Mayor Fred Jones Sr. who reveals that Fred's true parents are Brad and Judy from the original Mystery, Inc.

Although a dedicated man as seen through the efficiency in which he does his work, he can't or won't translate that eloquence into a better life for himself. He deludes himself into believing that his now twelve year cabbie job is temporary and that someday he will own his own limousine service. He even lies to his hospitalized mother that he already owns one, with a further lie that he tells her as such primarily to make her happy, rather than the truth which is that he won't do anything to achieve that dream. One night, Max picks up a well dressed man named Vincent, who asks Max to be his only fare for the evening. For a flat fee of $600, plus an extra $100 if he gets to the airport on time - Vincent wants Max to drive him to five stops that evening. Max somewhat reluctantly agrees. Max learns the hard way at their first stop when a body falls from a third story apartment window and lands dead on top of his cab that Vincent is a contract hit man. Vincent's main goal, as per his current contract, is to kill five people, one at each of the stops, but he will not let others get in the way of that goal, even if it means killing them, including Max. As Vincent forces Max to continue driving him for the evening, Max tries slyly at every turn to take back control of his life from Vincent, especially when Max learns of one of the names on Vincent's hit list. Meanwhile, LAPD narcotics detective, Ray Fanning, and ultimately the FBI get involved when Vincent's first victim is associated with a case in which Ray is working undercover. Ray is able to piece together information which makes him hot on Max and Vincent's tail.",7.5,"Tom Cruise,Jamie Foxx,Jada Pinkett Smith,Mark Ruffalo,Peter Berg,Bruce McGill,Irma P.

The first weekly challenge is the signature bake, the competitors to bake something from their home recipes which are to signify who they are as bakers within the category. The second weekly challenge is the technical challenge, where each of the competitors are provided the same recipe, in large part of something they may have never heard of let alone baked before in their lives. This challenge is to see how knowledgeable the competitors are about general baking concepts. Their finished products are evaluated blind in that the judges have no idea who baked what. The third weekly challenge is the showstopper challenge, in which the competitors are to pull out all the stops to produce a baked good which overall grand appearance is as important as taste. At the end of the week based solely on the three challenges, the judges will name the best competitor star baker, and will send one competitor home, that person whose competition has come to an end.

But it was also the age of Machievelli, of rampant lawlessness, incessant war, and unspeakable depravity. At the heart of the world order was the Vatican, the arbiter of conflicts between kingdoms and empires. And at the center of the Vatican was a man whose quest for power would propel him to seek the ultimate prize, the holy see of Rome. He was a man whose name would become synonymous with ruthlessness, and whose reign as Pope would be remembered as the most infamous chapter of the history of the Catholic church, Rodrigo Borgia. His four children -Juan, the oldest, a prideful, lazy, unscrupulous sexual predator, Cesare, a young man torn between a faith that was not his calling and his dark violent nature, Lucretia, a young girl discovering the secret power that a women's sexuality holds, and Goffredo, an innocent child who would come of age in a family riven by conflict, would provide Rodrigo with a challenge as great as the political maneuvering of his political and religious rivals. This show was a one hour dramatic series that chronicled the rise to power of this Spanish Cardinal and his clan, who sought to establish a dynasty that held sway over the entire world. Though a man of faith, Rodrigo was also in thrall to the pleasures of the flesh. Not only did he have to deal with the plotting and conspiracies of his fellow cardinals and the representatives of the great powers, but he was locked in a struggle to contain the bitter sibling rivalries that threatened to tear his family apart.

Among her possessions, Matilda discovers tantalising evidence, linking her mother to the Welsh girl's disappearance all those years ago. And so grief stricken Matilda travels to Wales, determined to find out who she really is, even if it means unraveling her own identity. In the process, she uncovers long buried secrets in this remote community - including one secret more bizarre, terrifying and dangerous than anything she could have imagined: Dark otherworldly forces are gathering - they have been waiting many years for Matilda to return. If every life is a story, then for most of us, it's our parents who write the opening chapters. They record and remember our early childhoods as we cannot, acting as trusted witnesses to our lives. But what if you discovered that your parent had lied to you? That almost everything they'd said about their own history, and yours, was untrue? Part supernatural thriller, part psychological horror, Requiem takes its inspiration from the psychological horror films of the late 1960s and '70s - Rosemary's Baby, Don't Look Now, and The Innocents, avoiding easy answers, and instead playing on uncertainty and ambiguity.

However one day, Cha Eun Sang learns that her sister is about to get married, and realizes she'll never return to Korea, so she'll forever have to wash dishes.

While he's studying with classmate Sophie Casterwill, they happen to find a magic Amulet and a journal left behind by Lok's missing father. However, the evil Organization, a group of evil monster summoners called Seekers are after the book. They attack Sophie and Lok with their monsters, called Titans. Sophie is also a Seeker and is able to defend herself, but Lok is forced into a dangerous chase to protect the journal. They join up with master adventurer Dante Vale, who is a heroic Seeker with the Huntik Foundation. Sophie wants to help Lok, because her family's secret symbol is on the cover of the journal. She hires Dante Vale with her family fortune to help them find Lok's father and train them both to be master Seekers. As they follow the clues to Prague, they add a new Seeker to the team, a mysterious lone wolf named Zhalia Moon, and a mysterious little Titan with the ability to talk, Cherit. When the mission to find Lok's father reaches a dead end, Dante and Zhalia let Lok and Sophie come with them on official Huntik Foundation missions, giving them excellent opportunities to develop their Seeker powers and find new Titans to help them in battle. The Huntik Team repeatedly clashes with the Organization, the scheming chemist DeFoe, the by-the-book Grier, the mad scientist Klaus, the powerful and competent Rassimov and the ultimate leader, The Professor. They defeat DeFoe and Grier takes his place, but he turns out to be an honorable man who used his power as an Organization officer to stop a civil war in his home country. Klaus proves to be extremely dangerous, and even reveals that Zhalia has been his double agent all along. Luckily, disaster is averted when Zhalia's feelings for Dante and the others cause her to switch sides at the last minute. Finally, Dante, Lok and the others pick up the trail of Lok's father and it leads them right to the Professor, the Legendary Titans of Mind, Body and Spirit, and a powerful artifact called the Ancient Amulet of Will. However, when they go to confront The Professor, he is much more manipulative than they could have imagined. He manages to convince the unflappable Dante to give up his Legendary Titans with the promise that The Professor would be able to cure Dante's mentor, Metz.

After a traumatic time serving as a mercenary at the Silesian front, Jan deserts from the Austrian army. Destitute and exhausted, he returns home, to the Flemish region of Aalst. To his surprise, everything has changed beyond recognition. His village has been transformed into a French army encampment. His family and friends have been outlawed and banished to Kluisbossen forest. Jan joins the ramshackle gang of robbers led by his half-brother Tincke. But in a country suffering under the yoke of poverty and exploitation, there's hardly anything left worth taking. Moved by these harsh living conditions, Jan manages to convince Tincke to see the bigger picture. Instead of stealing from each other, they should rob those who actually have money: the rich and the collaborators consorting with the French occupiers. John's ideas start to resonate and when a stagecoach is raided successfully, the ragtag bunch of scallywags develops into a real gang. The decision to share their booty with the poorest of the poor makes them popular, and their motto, ""Voor gene chanterik peu""(not afraid of anyone), spreads across the land like wildfire. When the authorities catch wind of this, the ambitious city guard Baru declares war on Jan and his gang. Thanks to his dedicated police work, Baru manages to infiltrate the gang and capture John. During his captivity, John's popularity only increases. The gang is out for revenge and will do anything to liberate Jan: it's the beginning of a war that leads to outright revolution. Jan de Lichte becomes a mythical folk hero. Even after his public execution some people believe John to be still alive.

When people head to Humboldt County, California in search of quick riches in the form of marijuana, often times they are unaware of the price they might ultimately pay in the illegal cannabis growing capital of the United States. The area produces at least 60% of the black market marijuana crop in the US, and also leads the state in missing persons cases. The series dives into the disappearance of one of these individuals, following the trail of 29-year-old Garret Rodriguez who goes missing on Murder Mountain. His disappearance and the events surrounding the investigation into his whereabouts threaten to expose a wild, lawless place, and will forever change the local community. The area known as Alderpoint - commonly known as Murder Mountain by residents, is not only mountainous and spacious but a surreal, little corner of America. ""Viewers will get an up close and personal look at a cast of isolationists, outlaws, vigilantes and other characters they won't soon forget,"" said Raphael Rodriguez, the Supervising Producer of ""Murder Mountain"" and Director of Programming and Production at FUSION. The six-part docuseries also explores Humboldt's marijuana farms - both legal and illegal - and provides a glimpse into what it takes for an outlaw farmer to cross over to the legal market. From describing the history of marijuana in the area to the current role of ""trimmigrants""-people from out of town who come to work the harvest-, ""Murder Mountain"" unravels a place of incredible natural beauty, where marijuana has become the dominant local industry.

They hire Erica, a girl from Ethan's high school who is a huge fan of ""Dusk"", as a babysitter. However, Erica comes across her best friend Sarah, and Jesse, Sarah's vampire ex-boyfriend, on the night she is to babysit, and decides to attend a party that Jesse is throwing instead. During a fight between Sarah and Jesse, Sarah ends up at Ethan's house and tells Ethan's parents that she was asked to babysit instead. Ethan has a vision when touching Sarah, and notices she has no reflection in the mirror, leaving him suspicious of her. He confides this in his dorky best friend, Benny. Sarah leaves to get Erica back from the party, knowing the party is full of bloodthirsty vampires. Curious, the boys have Benny's grandmother watch over Jane while they follow Sarah. They see her feed on a rat and realize she is a vampire. Sarah quickly explains that she is only a fledgling, a vampire who has not drunk human blood. The three of them return home, where they are attacked by a vampire sent by Jesse. The vampire is subdued by Sarah and they head to the vampire party to save Erica and and their dimwitted friend, Rory. However, Erica has been bitten by Gord and later bites Rory. Ethan, Benny, and Sarah then battle the vampires and escape. The next day, Rory, now a full vampire after drinking human blood, informs Ethan and Benny that Jesse's gang are going to church so Ethan, Benny and Sarah follow them. Ethan has a vision in which he sees a gravestone, whose dates unscramble to the number 219, and a mysterious box, which is then uncovered by the vampires. The box is called the Cubile Animus or ""Nest of Souls."" Ethan and Sarah figure out Jesse's full plan from an old book, learning that in the original settlement of the town, there was a priest named Reverend Horace Black that led an evil vampire cult. The townspeople burned the cult members, leading to all ""219"" of their deaths during a lunar eclipse. In another vision, Ethan sees that Jesse is Horace Black, and plans to use the box to trap the souls of teens going to see a movie premiere to resurrect the souls of his ancient cult during the lunar eclipse occurring on that same night. Benny's grandmother, who reveals that she is an Earth Priestess, gives Ethan, Benny and Sarah enchanted daggers and a spellbook to defeat the vampires. She explains that Ethan sees visions because he is a Seer, which enables him to see visions through touch, and that Benny is a spellmaster, allowing him to cast spells. At the theater, the vampires begin to steal the souls of the teens, but are thwarted by Ethan, Benny and Sarah. Jesse escapes and Ethan and Benny follow in pursuit. In another vision, Ethan sees the tree he saw inside the old book, realizing it's the tree in his backyard, where they find Jesse. As the eclipse begins, Jesse attempts to hold Ethan and Benny down and resurrect the souls he already obtained from the Cubile Animus, but Sarah intervenes. When the box lands in Ethan's hands, he releases the vengeful souls that were captured, and they destroy Jesse.

Using cybernetic implants, the Agency uses a process called 'conditioning' to turn orphaned children into emotionless killing machines with hardly any memories, no human comfort and worst of all, no free will. The girls who make up the assassination unit within the Social Welfare agency are Henrietta, Triela, Claes, Rico and Angelica, all whom have shady backgrounds which led to their involvement with the agency. Each girl is skilled in martial arts, weapons and tactics, demolitions, foreign languages, espionage and counter-terrorism, skills that are necessary when dealing with terrorism, illegal arms deals or even crime organizations who have a serious stranglehold on the country of Europe. But while these girls are the perfect weapons against these types of everyday problems, they must constantly do their best to hold on to what little pieces of their humanity they have left, as they are being forced to commit cold-blooded murder, sometimes even killing innocent people who get in the way. Jose, Henrietta's handler doesn't like the way she and the other girls are being treated as tools for massacre and it pains him everyday to see Henrietta and her friends having to go through this type of life. But if Henrietta and the others want to live to see tomorrow, they have to play the guinea pigs and earn their keep, by getting their hands dirty for the Social Welfare agency, who is responsible for giving them their second chance at life.

To help him navigate his new environment, his parents (Tom Everett Scott and Larisa Oleynik) get Noah a scruffy, high-energy emotional support dog called Dude (Steve Zahn). While Dude's a novice with a short attention span and a distracting obsession with treats, what he lacks in experience, he makes up for in charm, spunk and wanting the best for Noah. If this unlikely pair can find a way to overcome their differences and work together, they may just survive everything from wisecracking pre-teens to a cat-obsessed school principal and make it through the school year.

He will stop at nothing to outwit the enemy and teachers, relatives and babysitters avoid him at all costs. Even his parents argue over whose turn it is to look after him!

In 1973, a lone armed man, thought to be American, storms the downtown Stockholm branch of Kreditbanken. Ultimately the authorities, led by Chief of Police Mattsson learn of his at-gunpoint demand: $1 million US, the release of convicted bank robber and murderer Gunnar Sorensson, and a Mustang Boss 302 like the one Steve McQueen drove in Bullitt (1968) as a getaway vehicle for the two of them. By the time Mattsson gets Sorensson to the bank - unknown to the gunman, who is thought to be well known robber Kaj Hansson, Sorenson having made a plea deal with Mattsson for his cooperation against the gunman - there are three hostages at the bank, all the others that were in the bank at the time let go. Arguably the most lucid of the three is bank clerk Bianca Lind, a wife and mother of two preschool aged children. Ultimately she is able to figure out that the gunman is not Hansson as Mattsson suspects, but rather Lars Nystrom, what she knowing of his past crimes chief being his humane treatment of people he held at gunpoint. Beyond what Sorensson decides to do with his ultimate goal not to go back to prison, what happens largely depends on Lind, who begins to trust Nystrom more than either Mattsson or Prime Minister Olof Palme whose actions and decisions she believes from what she can see are more of a potential physical detriment to her and her fellow two hostages than that of Nystrom.",6.1,"Ethan Hawke,Noomi Rapace,Mark Strong,Christopher Heyerdahl,Bea Santos,Mark Rendall,Ian Matthews,John Ralston,Shanti Roney,Christopher Wagelin,Thorbjørn Harr,Gustaf Hammarsten,Vladimir Jon Cubrt,Nonnie Griffin,Anders Yates,Linzee Barclay,Michael Rinaldi,Nick Stojanovic,Shay Santaiti,Nora Prinzen-Klages,Lars Classington,Scott Mccrickard,Jonelle Gunderson,David Christo,Jessica Sherman,Clive Walton,John Jarvis,Daniel Falk,Hanneke Talbot,Uhraney Adrian,Rebecka Andersson,Carrie Beale,Michael Coady,Iman Mirbioki,Alexander Musgrove,Violetta Pioro","Canada:14A::(Alberta),Canada:PG::(British Columbia),Denmark:15::(DVD and Blu-ray rating),Finland:K-12::(DVD and Blu-ray rating),Hong Kong:IIB,Iceland:16,Italy:T,Japan:G,Netherlands:16,New Zealand:M,Norway:15::(DVD and Blu-ray rating),Portugal:M/12,South Africa:13,Spain:16,Sweden:11,United Kingdom:15,United States:R,Ukraine:16",NA,movie

Nat, a marketing company manager, is more professional and controlled. Josh, a novelist with a current case of writer's block, is more carefree and childlike. Nine months into their marriage, Nat and Josh have their first session with arguably the most distracted marriage counselor in the city, that session which may be the deciding factor in whether they continue in being husband and wife to each other. Their issues over the preceding nine months are told in flashback, and include little idiosyncrasies which annoy the other, and tensions with each's in-laws, beyond the general differences in their personalities. But what may be the biggest threat to a happily-ever-after for them as a couple may be temptations with others to who, at least on paper, each is more well suited. For Nat, that temptation is client Guy Harrap, an American manufacturer who, unknown to Nat, hired her firm solely in his personal attraction to her.

Dr. Ballard and a team of experts -- including Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin; TV personality Bill Nye the Science Guy; and oceanographers, climatologists, professional surfers, fishermen and boat pilots -- travel the world, seeking answers to questions at the root of earth and humanity. To find these answers, Dr. Ballard visits breathtaking sites from volcanoes submerged more than 3,000 feet beneath the Hawaiian islands, to shipwrecks on forgotten ancient Greek trade routes, to cracks in the ocean floor where red-hot magma pours into open water, with cameras capturing never-before-seen rock formations, lava vents and unusual species that call the ocean bottom home. The five episodes are: ""Fires of Creation,"" which highlights his trip from the top of Mauna Kea volcano to the crown of Loihi, its submerged cousin known as the youngest volcano in the Hawaiian Archipelago, showing how heat and magma bubble up to create life and new land masses; ""Wrecks of the Abyss,"" which documents his deep-water search for ancient shipwrecks in the Mediterranean, informing our understanding of maritime travel from Greece to Egypt in the ancient world; ""It's Alive,"" which features his search for life in the darkness and chill of waters thousands of feet beneath the surface on the slopes of the Mid-Ocean ridges, where molten lava superheats the ocean, mixing in the nutrients for marine life that has adapted to the harsh environment; ""Ocean's Fury,"" which seeks to understand whether the ocean is growing more dangerous by the day and how rogue waves are getting larger and more frequent on the seas; and ""Inner vs. Outer Space,"" which explores how the Earth's waters -- and not outer space -- may be the key to long-term survival of the human race.",6.8,"Jean Pierre Arabonis,Adam Arrighi,Rich Bell,Mike Brennan,Celia Cackowski,Dwight Coleman,Sean Collins,Alex DeCiccio,Dan Jordan,Robert Knott,Dave LePage,Brennan Phillips,Bob Pickart,Timothy Shank,Valerie Vinciullo,Brenton Wallin,Bryan Cranston,Robert Ballard,Buzz Aldrin,Ben Ballard,Emily Ballard,Graham Hawkes,Kakani Katija,Pascal Lee,Larry Mayer,Bill Nye,Neil Anthony Sims,Katy Croff Bell,Stephanie Nebel",NA,1,tv series

The show airs on Disney Junior (both English and French) in Canada, the Sprout channel in the United States, Tiny Pop in the United Kingdom, and Kids Talk Talk Plus in South Korea. The show revolves around the adventures of Justin. In every episode, Justin encounters a real-world problem of everyday childhood (such as sharing, teamwork, or paying attention). Then Justin and his shape-shifting sidekick Squidgy solve the problems by tackling them in imaginary adventures through time and around the world. In every adventure, Justin and Squidgy meet their best friend Olive, who always lives in the place and time they are visiting, and who usually needs their help to accomplish a task. Together, the three of them encounter the same problem that Justin faces in the real world, and together they solve the problem before Justin's parents call him back to the real world. In the original concept, Justin travelled via a time machine, which led to the title ""Justin Time"".[1] Because the concept of ""the past"" is challenging for pre-schoolers, the show instead focuses on more developmentally appropriate adventures of make-believe. It is noticed that the Canadian flag is blue and white instead of its official red and white in the theme song. In November 2014 it was announced that Netflix were to create a new original spin-off series entitled 'Justin Time: The New Adventures. The spin-off will follow Justin and best friends Olive and Squidgy on more fantastical adventures around the globe, and will comprise of thirteen half-hour episodes to be released for streaming in early 2016.[2] Justin Time was nominated for a 2013 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Pre-School Animated Program,[3] and for a 2013 Annie Award for Best Animated Television Production For Preschool Children.[4] ""Brandon Scott James Blog"".

Fourteen-year-old Ponyboy Curtis is the youngest of three orphaned brothers who live on the north side of town, the ""wrong side"" of the tracks. Sensitive Ponyboy used to have a good relationship with his oldest brother Darrel, but since Darrel became the household caregiver, he is always on Ponyboy's case. Caught in the middle is third brother Sodapop, who dropped out of school to work full time. They all belong to The Greasers, a gang of boys from the north side also from working class families, often broken. Ponyboy's main concern is that any problem they may encounter, especially in their Greaser activities, will lead to the authorities splitting up their family. He also believes Darrel would have outgrown them and become something in his life if it wasn't for his loyalty to the gang, and the need to take care of the family. The rest of the world sees the Greasers as all the same, the face being Dallas Winston, the most volatile one who has just been released from prison, despite each boy having his own specific view of life. Similarly, the world sees the Socs, the Greasers' primary rivals, as all the same, rich spoiled entitled boys with a sense of superiority from the south side of town, despite again each boy being his own person. A connection between the two gangs happens in the form of Ponyboy and Cherry Valance, which doesn't sit well with Cherry's Soc boyfriend, Bob Sheldon. As a result, an incident occurs involving the Socs, Ponyboy and fellow Greaser, sixteen-year-old Johnny Cade, an equally sensitive boy who wants a better life for himself, but seems stuck in a downward spiral with parents who don't give him the time of day. Beyond Ponyboy and Johnny's lives being threatened by that incident, the Greasers and the Socs agree to a rumble to settle things once and for all. Some of the boys realize the rumble will accomplish nothing, with the questions being if they can convince their colleagues of the same, and if not what the consequences will be.",7.1,"C.

The safest place for them to go is San Fermin, her hometown, about an hour away from the capital, where Juana finds not only a hiding place, but also reconnects with her past. This reconnection is personified by Ambrosio, her father and the mayor of San Fermin, with whom she had broken off relations fifteen years before. Soon Juana is going to discover that San Fermin, like many other small towns in Latin America, has become a sort of backyard to the capital and home to a large, unpopular, and undesired landfill. After saving a girl from a fire and becoming an unexpected heroine, Juana will be convinced that she can give something back to the welcoming community by working with her father on the city council. After a while, Juana will uncover a dark case of political corruption that directly involves her father and the powerful company that manages the town's landfill. This will lead her to become an inexperienced but convictional mayor, who courageously faces the various injustices that the town suffers. In the midst of enormous sacrifices to her personal life and family, Juana and her loyal team fight to mobilize the people and demand that central government put a stop to corruption.

In temperatures that reach 40 below - where skin freezes, snowmobiles break down, daylight fades fast, thin ice looms and predators are a constant threat - one wrong move can cost you everything.

Narrated by well-known voice talent Peter Thomas, this series takes viewers on an exciting adventure to the heart of our liquid planet. The oceans cover roughly 70 percent of the earth's surface and they contain 97 percent of the world's water supply. Nevertheless, only five percent of their vast expanse has been explored - leaving in secret a deep, liquid wilderness yet to be discovered. Regardless, the oceans have long played an important role in people's lives. Currently, more than half of all Americans live within 50 miles of the coast, and that number is rising. It is estimated that by 2025 more than 75 percent of Americans will live along the country's shorelines. Coastal and marine waters support 28 million jobs and draw 189 million tourists a year. While the population's dependence on the oceans as a natural resource and a source for recreation continues to increase, the health of these large bodies of water is rapidly declining. Over-fishing, global climate change, pollution: these are only a few of the threats that the oceans are facing today. At the same time, the seas hold great promise for ongoing medical research, as an untapped source of alternate energy, and other benefits that scientists are just now beginning to discover. Changing Seas goes to sea with explorers and scientists as they uncover new information that could lead to scientific breakthroughs.

Each week, they are given a set amount of time to complete each of three challenges, their finished products which are evaluated by expert judges. The first weekly challenge is the signature bake, the competitors to bake something from their home recipes which are to signify who they are as bakers within the category. The second weekly challenge is the technical challenge, where each of the competitors are provided the same recipe, in large part of something they may have never heard of let alone baked before in their lives. This challenge is to see how knowledgeable the competitors are about general baking concepts. Their finished products are evaluated blind in that the judges have no idea who baked what. The third weekly challenge is the showstopper challenge, in which the competitors are to pull out all the stops to produce a baked good which overall grand appearance is as important as taste. At the end of the week based solely on the three challenges, the judges will name the best competitor star baker, and will send one competitor home, that person whose competition has come to an end.

At first James and Grace manage to live happily, sustained by their love, but they are both fond of wealth and luxury, and when the uncle dies, leaving a will stating that if they get a divorce the fortune will be given to James and a large allowance to Grace, they decide that they will get more out of life by taking advantage of the will's offer, than by trying to live together on fifteen dollars a week. Grace leaves for Reno to get a divorce. When she parts from James she cannot hold hack her tears, and her young husband is heart-broken. With Grace is a young friend of the old studio days, named May. She is artful and deceitful, and plans to get as much of Grace's future allowance as she can. Needing a friend to sustain her in her hour of trouble, Grace gladly confides in May, withholding nothing from her. May goes to Reno with Grace and encourages her to hasten divorce proceedings, fearing all the time that Grace may lose courage and renounce the allowance. Grace reaches Reno and engages William Marshall, a shrewd lawyer. While the court proceedings are in progress, Jim Evans, in New York, is so disconsolate that he starts a wild flirtation with Helen Greene. But he is unable to stand the separation and writes to Grace's lawyer to stop the divorce proceedings, saying that he will renounce the legacy to get back his wife. But Marshall intends to marry Grace and wires back that the divorce is about to be granted and cannot be recalled. Marshall is aided at all times by May, Grace's deceitful friend, who more than ever longs for a share of Grace's money. Grace sees in a newspaper that Jim is engaged to Helen Greene. It is really s false report, but she does not know this, and she is so heartbroken that when Marshall proposes, she accepts him. But May is in an adjoining room and overhears the proposal. She loves Marshall and is fearfully jealous of Grace. When the lawyer finds that she is there he excuses himself and goes in to see her, anxious to get her out of the way. Then Grace sees Jim's letter asking Marshall to stop the divorce and she grabs the divorce papers and tears them up. As soon as James hears that his wife is coming back he heads off a note he has sent to Helen Greene saying that he will marry her. James and Grace are overjoyed when they learn that the uncle has left a later will stating that his nephew shall inherit the fortune if, after six months, he proves that his love for Grace is greater than his fondness for money.

With her husband at death's door, Floyd takes over the family business, frustrating her eldest son, Dodd Gerhardt. An impatient hothead with a cruel streak to match his ambitions, Dodd can't wait for both his parents to die so he can take over and expand their business from kingdom to empire. Bear Gerhardt is the middle son, an intimidatingly large man who, although inarticulate, is the most decent of his clan. Rye Gerhardt, the youngest of the Gerhardt clan, views himself as a big shot, but in reality he's just a small dog who barks big.",8.9,"Allison Tolman,Billy Bob Thornton,Colin Hanks,Martin Freeman,Russell Harvard,Bokeem Woodbine,Brad Mann,Kirsten Dunst,Ewan McGregor,Chris Rock,Patrick Wilson,Carrie Coon,Jessie Buckley,Jesse Plemons,Mary Elizabeth Winstead,Jason Schwartzman,David Thewlis,Ted Danson,Emyri Crutchfield,James Vincent Meredith,Jean Smart,Bob Odenkirk,Keith Carradine,Cristin Milioti,Anji White,Joey King,Jeremie Harris,Matthew Elam,Francesco Acquaroli,Zahn McClarnon,Angus Sampson,Rodney L Jones III,Jack Huston,Salvatore Esposito,Michael Stuhlbarg,Andrew Bird,Corey Hendrix,Andy Yu,Gaetano Bruno,Karen Aldridge,Em Haine,Will Clinger,Ben Whishaw,Jeffrey Donovan,Olivia Sandoval,Rachel Keller,Graham Verchere,Timothy Olyphant,Kelsey Asbille,Raven Stewart","Australia:MA15+,Brazil:14,Canada:18A::(Alberta/British Columbia/Ontario),Canada:14A::(Nova Scotia),Canada:13+::(Québec),Canada:14A::(Season 2),Canada:18A::(Seasons 1 and 3),Canada:14+::(TV rating),Denmark:15,Finland:K-16,France:Tous publics,Germany:16,India:16+::(self-applied),Ireland:15,Italy:VM14,Japan:PG12::(self-applied),Mexico:TV-MA::(self-applied),Netherlands:16,New Zealand:R16,Norway:15,Poland:16,Russia:18+,Singapore:M18,South Africa:16,Spain:18::(DVD rating),Spain:18::(TV rating),Sweden:15,United Kingdom:15,United States:TV-MA",4,tv series

Filled with dreams of being a cool teenager, Chris moves with his family from the projects to the ""Bed-Stuy: Do or Die"" neighborhood. As the family's emergency adult while his parents are working, he's responsible for taking care of his younger brother Drew (Tequan Richmond), who's taller and more confident than Chris, and sister Tonya (Imani Hakim), who gets all the parents' attention. Chris' rough, cost-conscious father Julius (Terry Crews) works numerous jobs to properly support his family. Sassy mom Rochelle (Tichina Arnold) runs the household on a tight budget, is very strict, and works part-time in a small real estate office. With his mom determined to see him in a good school, though Drew and Tonya go to the same school in their old neighborhood, Chris reluctantly faces multiple bus transfers every day to attend Corleone Junior High in the fiercely Italian neighborhood, South Shore. Despite being an immediate target for bullies, Chris' innate charm and sharp wit enable him to make new friends, like Greg (Vincent Martella), another smart, nice kid... who can't fight, by the way. As Chris Rock pointedly looks back, his younger self is set to find what his family already knows: Chris' sharp, scrappy character is going to take him places. But first, he's going to have to think, talk, or run his way through one growing experience after another at home and school... and on any number of buses along the way.",7.4,"Terry Crews,Tichina Arnold,Tequan Richmond,Imani Hakim,Vincent Martella,Tyler James Williams,Chris Rock,Travis T.

And while the stigma of her accident could be the curse of her life, Jenna's determined to make it her life's blessing.",7.5,"Ashley Rickards,Beau Mirchoff,Jillian Rose Reed,Brett Davern,Molly Tarlov,Nikki Deloach,Desi Lydic,Greer Grammer,Mike Faiola,Jessica Lu,Barret Swatek,Niko Pepaj,Wesam Keesh,Monty Geer,Evan Crooks,Evan Williams,Erinn Westbrook,Nolan Gerard Funk,Kelly Sry,Tru Collins,Brian Ames,Meaghan Martin,Elizabeth Whitson,Matthew Fahey,Kofi Siriboe,Anthony Michael Hall,Jenna Lamia,Joseph Haro,Neil Garguilo,Brando Eaton,Amanda Foreman,Rachel Melvin,Jonathan Bennett,Heather Mazur,Shane Harper,Hope Lauren,Jessika Van,Deanna Lee Douglas,Hannah Marks,Evanne Friedmann,Janelle Velasquez,Zak Henri,Jared Abrahamson,Justin Prentice,Doug DeBeech,Sunkrish Bala,Tuc Watkins,Monica Giraldo,Shelby Rabara,Nina Rausch","Australia:M,Brazil:12,Canada:14A::(Manitoba/Nova Scotia/Ontario),Canada:13+::(Quebec),France:Tous publics,Germany:12,Ireland:15,Netherlands:6,Netherlands:AL::(seasons 3 and 4),New Zealand:M,Spain:TP,United Kingdom:15,United Kingdom:12::(season 1, disc 2),United States:TV-14",5,tv series

He not so much employs Barry and Dick, but rather keeps them around as they showed up at the store one day and never left. All three are vinyl and music snobs, but in different ways. Rob has a penchant for compiling top five lists. The latest of these lists is his top five break-ups, it spurred by the fact that his latest girlfriend, Laura, a lawyer, has just broken up with him. He believed that Laura would be the one who would last, partly as an expectation of where he would be at this stage in his life. Rob admits that there have been a few incidents in their relationship which in and of themselves could be grounds for her to want to break up. To his satisfaction, Laura is not on this top five list. Rob feels a need not only to review the five relationships, which go back as far as middle school when he was twelve, and try to come to terms with why the woman, or girl as the case may be, left him, but also, in the words of Charlie Nicholson, number four on the list, ""what it all means"" for why he has ended up where he is, which is nowhere, personally or professionally, close to what he envisioned.

During his tour is when Cameron first sees Bianca Stratford, a beautiful sophomore with one problem: she isn't allowed to date. And neither is her ""shrew"" sister, Katarina, a senior who loves indie rock and feminist prose and hates conformity. But Kat and Bianca's father alters his house rule: now, Bianca can date... as long as Kat has a date, too. Now, in order for Cameron to date Bianca, he has to find someone to date Kat. So Michael helps him enlist the help of pretty-boy/jerk/model Joey Donner, tricking him into thinking that *he* will get to take Bianca out if he pays someone to take out Kat. His choice: Patrick Verona, a bad-boy with a mysterious reputation--some say he ate a live duck once, others that he lit a state trooper on fire, and even more claim that he had a brief porn career.

Due to the intense enemy fire, the planes are shot down and most soldiers die in the landing or are killed by the Nazis' night patrols after they land. However, a private named Ed Boyce survives to find Corporal Ford, a last-minute incorporation from Italy and a veteran expert in bombs and explosives, rogue sniper Tibbet, war photographer Chase, and finally private Dawson. After they watch the killing of their superior Sergeant Eldson by a Nazi night patrol, Ford becomes leader of the group and they try to get the town with the tower in order to complete the mission. In the forest close to the town they meet Chloe, a villager who assists the soldiers in her home with her elderly aunt and little brother Paul. But the mission gets complicated when, by accident, Boyce ends up inside the Nazi radio tower, only to find horrible secret experiments with human beings that could empower a victory for Hitler and would change the fate of the world forever. With D-Day approaching, Boyce and the others begin to realize there is more going on in this Nazi-occupied village than a simple military operation.

Charles Falco opted to go undercover and for the next three years he led a crazy and dangerous life infiltrating the Vagos motorcycle gang, collecting evidence while faced with the constant risk that he might be discovered and become one of the gang's victims. Each episode unfolds a different step in Falco's covert investigation into their illegal activities, while across the series, the drama builds as carefully constructed character arcs unfold bitter personal rivalries. These tensions finally erupt when the gang's Vice President is killed in a motorcycle accident, unleashing a chain of unforeseen consequences that ultimately tear the gang apart. With suspicions about Falco's true identity mounting, the operation threatens to unravel, leading to a tense and dramatic conclusion. Drawing on the wealth of material from Falco's time under cover, along with broader documented historical research of inter gang rivalry, this series dramatically captures the reality of outlaw biker counter culture: a world where freedom is equated with the right to carry guns and trade drugs with impunity, and respect can be earned through fear... following the conclusion of his undercover operation with the Vagos, the reformed Falco goes into witness protection... but hooked on the adrenaline rush of undercover work he volunteers to go undercover inside not just one, but two more biker gangs...",8.2,"Damon Runyan,Ian Matthews,Ari Cohen,Stephen Eric McIntyre,Thomas Mitchell,Hannah Emily Anderson,Shaun Benson,Joanne Boland,Justin Mader,Philip Williams,Christian Bako,Don Masters,Paulino Nunes,James Cade,Melanie Scrofano,Don Francks,Ryan Blakely,Ashley Tredenick,Mary Ashton,Chris Ratz,Romano Orzari,Kiran Friesen,Brendan Eckstrom,Shawn J.

2372,Jeopardy!,1964,all,8.2,,0,1,0,0,1,NA,Game-Show,United States,English,30,NA,"On the heels of the syndicated success of ""Wheel of Fortune (1983)"", producer Merv Griffin decided to return his classic quiz show-with-a-twist, ""Jeopardy!"" to the airwaves in 1984. It, too, was a huge success, and also marked a return to the game's tried-and-true formula of answers and questions (after a slightly-modified remake six years earlier failed to catch on). Three contestants, including a returning champion, competed. Six categories are announced (e.g., Art World, Cooking, 20th Century Republicans, ""Friends (1994)"", Muscle Men and College Girls Wearing White T-shirts), each having five answers ostensibly graded by difficulty, from $100 to $500. The champion chose a category and dollar amount (e.g., ""College Girls Wearing White T-shirts for $100""), to which host Trebek reads the answer (""Inspector 12 must give her seal of approval before a college girl can wear one of these plain white T-shirts""). Contestants had to respond in question form (""What is Hanes?"") ; if correct, they won the value of the question; if he/she was incorrect, failed to answer in time or phrase in the form of a question, that amount was deducted (hence, the dollar amount was ""always in jeopardy"") and his/her opponents could answer; having enough incorrect answers often led to negative scores. Thereafter, the contestant providing the last correct question selected next, and the process repeated; some answers made use of audio and/or video clues. Hidden behind one of the answers was a ""Daily Double"" space, with the contestant selecting that space able to wager up to all his/her current winnings or up to $500 if he/she had less) on the answer. After all 30 answers have been revealed (or sometimes, an undefined time limit expired), the game moved into ""Double Jeopardy!"" Gameplay was the same in ""Double Jeopardy!"" except six new categories were announced and the answers had values of $200 to $1,000 and two ""Daily Double"" spaces were hidden (with contestants able to wager up to $1,000 if they had less). At the end of the ""Double Jeopardy!"" round, all contestants with at least $1 were eligible to play ""Final Jeopardy!""; however, anyone with $0 or a negative score was disqualified from further play. Trebek announced a category, and the contestants (before seeing the answer) wagered up to everything they had on their ability to answer. Contestants had 30 seconds to write what they believed was the correct question. Those who were correct had the amount they wagered added to their winnings; however, any incorrect questions or failing to phrase properly lost what they wagered. The contestant with the most cash was champion, kept his/her winnings and got to return the next day. Champions competed until they won five shows (at which point they retired undefeated and, starting in 1997, also won a new car) or until they were defeated. All five-time champions and other high-scoring contestants over a period of time participated in a Tournament of Champions, the winner earning an additional $100,000; there were also teen, college, senior and international tournaments and celebrity shows conducted (the winners of the non-celebrity tournaments also earned a spot in the Tournament of Champions). In the fall of 2001, several changes were made, including the use of a ""Clue Crew"" (new regulars illustrating answers in selected categories by going ""on location""), and an increase in the dollar values of the answers (from $200 to $1,000 in Jeopardy! and $400 to $2,000 in Double Jeopardy!) ; another running change through the years was the addition of ""celebrity guests"" reading certain answers. None of the changes altered the basic game play, however.",8.2,"Johnny Gilbert,Alex Trebek,Jimmy McGuire,Sarah Whitcomb Foss,Kelly Miyahara,Ken Jennings,Jon Cannon,Cheryl Farrell,Brad Rutter,James Holzhauer,Julia Collins,Austin Rogers,Buzzy Cohen,Mehmet Oz,Alan Lin,Roger Craig,Anderson Cooper,Jason Zuffranieri,Seth Wilson,Ben Ingram,Arthur Chu,India Cooper,Jerome Vered,Chuck Forrest,David Madden,Frank Spangenberg,Bob Harris,Michael McKean,Alex Jacob,Larissa Kelly,Colby Burnett,Kerry Greene,Aaron Rodgers,Katie Couric,Pam Mueller,Jason Zollinger,Tim Aten,Mike Richards,Stefan Goodreau,Justin Bernbach,Tom Nissley,Jeff Probst,Neil deGrasse Tyson,Kyle Jones,Leonard Cooper,Vijay Balse,Jennifer Giles,Matt Jackson,Bob Verini,Pranjal Vachaspati","Australia:G,Canada:G,Singapore:G,United States:TV-G,United States:TV-PG::(TV rating)",37,tv series

Drummond had made a promise to their dying mother, his housekeeper, that he would care for the boys after she passes away; their father had died years earlier. The boys, whom Drummond always introduced as his two sons, went from rags to riches literally overnight. At first, Willis was rather skeptical of their newfound wealth, but eventually, both he and Arnold felt right at home in their newfound surroundings. Also part of the family were Drummond's beautiful daughter, 13-year-old Kimberly; and his no-nonsense housekeeper, Edna Garrett. As the years passed, Mrs. Garrett left to become housemother at the Eastland School for Girls; she was replaced by the cantankerous Adelaide Brubaker and still later, charming Pearl Gallagher. Arnold's friends, Dudley and Robbie (and later, Charlie); Willis' girlfriend, Charlene; cast members from ""The Facts of Life""; and Drummond's sister, Sophia, were frequently seen. In early 1984, Drummond found true love, marrying fitness instructor Maggie McKinney; she had a 6-year-old son, Sam. While most series revolved around the typical lessons of growing up, some were quite serious (including a frightening encounter with a child molester and a memorable episode dealing with drug abuse guest starring First Lady Nancy Reagan).",6.7,"Conrad Bain,Gary Coleman,Todd Bridges,Dana Plato,Mary Jo Catlett,Danny Cooksey,Shavar Ross,Charlotte Rae,Dixie Carter,Steven Mond,Nedra Volz,Mary Ann Mobley,Nikki Swasey Seaton,Janet Jackson,Jason Hervey,Rosalind Chao,Dody Goodman,Bobby Herbeck,Robert Rockwell,Robin LaValley,Le Tari,Kim Fields,Erik Moses,Robert Jayne,John Starr,Anthony Thompkins,Jack Riley,Melanie Watson,Tony Williams,Verda Bridges,Steve Brady,McLean Stevenson,Kim Richards,Joanna Gleason,Brian Whitley,Brad Trumbull,James Reynolds,Tyren Perry,Elaine Appleton,Dana Kimmell,Joan Welles,Rhoda Gemignani,Krista Errickson,Gordon Jump,Ron Feinberg,Dabney Coleman,Whitman Mayo,George Pentecost,Jack Knight,Shannon Presby","Argentina:Atp,Australia:G::(some episodes),Australia:PG::(some episodes),Brazil:Livre,Canada:G::(Manitoba/Nova Scotia/Quebec),France:Tous Public,Ireland:PG,New Zealand:PG,Norway:A::(recommended rating),Singapore:PG,United Kingdom:PG::(most episodes),United Kingdom:U::(one episode),United States:TV-PG::(some episodes),United States:TV-G::(some episodes)",8,tv series

However, he had one thing that kept him going - the Blaster Blade, a card from a card game that was given to him when he was little. That card is the reason why he begins to engage in Cardfights, something that changes his life drastically. The name of the card game is Vanguard. The game takes place in a different planet called Cray. It is a place similar to our own planet, but unlike planet Earth, Gods and Demons, Dragons and other mythical creatures still roam the land. It is also a world where both Magic and Science have advanced hand in hand. Countries with advances in different fields and cultures rule over different parts of the planet Cray.

She's prone to stammering and clutziness. She has a huge crush on her senpai, Mytho, a melancholy young man who doesn't speak much. Ahiru discovers that Mytho is actually the prince out of a story written by the mysterious Drosselmeyer. When Drosselmeyer died, the prince and the evil crow that were battling in his novel escaped. The prince defeated the crow, but only at the expense of shattering his own heart. Mytho is a boy without feeling or understanding. Drosselmeyer, however, has somehow returned, and has offered Ahiru a chance to help Mytho. She must become Princess Tutu, a magical ballerina, and help reclaim the pieces of her prince's heart. There is a catch, of course--Mytho is being controlled by his roommate Fakir, also a dancer, who seems to want to keep the boy soulless and heartless. Drosselmeyer also told Ahiru that a certain dream she's been having is real. She really is just a little duck, and has been transformed into a girl only so that she can become Princess Tutu. If she starts stammering-- quacking like a duck-- she'll turn back into one.",8.1,"Takahiro Sakurai,Christine M.
