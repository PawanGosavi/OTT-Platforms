Shorten that to every second, and you've got Coupling. It's more than just a one night stand! When a couple gets together, it's never just the two of them - they also bring baggage - and Susan and Steve are no exception. Their baggage is a crowd of best friends and exes who talk about all aspects of sex and relationships on their never-ending quest to find true love. Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps... Susan Walker is a beautiful go-getter with an uninhibited attitude who used to date Patrick Maitland, the sextet's charismatic, cocky player, London's king of conquests - a guy who's just too cool to worry about being smart. Attractive Sally Harper is a beauty therapist who is Susan's unashamedly vain best friend, who aggressively battles aging with heavy doses of moisturizer and men - including Patrick. Meanwhile, Steve Taylor, while getting together with Susan, can't seem to shake loose from his vivacious and slightly vacuous ex-girlfriend Jane Christie, a woman supremely confident in her ability to seduce anyone of either sex, and who refuses to be dumped unless she's the one doing the dumping. Jeff Murdoch is Steve's ""porn buddy"" who is, in equal parts, obsessed and bewildered by actual sex; charming in his way, but with an uncanny ability to say the wrong thing at the worst possible time. He works in the same office as Susan, with whom he had a disastrous and unsuccessful one-night fling. Coupling has been honoured with the prestigious Silver Rose of Montreux, Best TV Comedy Award, and is recent winner at the 2003 British Comedy Awards. With a new guy on the scene, a baby on the way, commitment in the air, and love on the horizon, the dynamics of the six friends are definitely changing. At the end of last season Susan and Steve discovered they were pregnant (well, mostly Susan), confirmed bachelor Patrick and Sally finally admitted their true feelings for each other, and poor Jane was left on her own, once again. But it's not all doom and gloom for Jane. As the new season opens, things are looking up. There's this guy called Oliver, who has his eye on her. Is it possible that lifetime loser in love Oliver might just get somewhere with lifetime loser in love Jane? Trouble is, his apartment is a little ""un-edited"" and his living room has lost the battle with magazine nudity... Susan and Steve are now well and truly an item. So why is he dreaming about being executed by a fetus with an axe? Meanwhile Sally and Patrick are settling into their new relationship. But since the dawn of time, men and women have been falling in love - and men have been trying to get home straight afterwards. Can fallen playboy Patrick ever find his way back from the enchanted glade of his one true love and get a decent night's sleep?",8.5,"Jack Davenport,Gina Bellman,Sarah Alexander,Kate Isitt,Ben Miles,Richard Coyle,Richard Mylan,Lou Gish,Olivia Caffrey,Mariella Frostrup,Lloyd Owen,Elizabeth Marmur,Emilia Fox,Adam Astill,Michael Price,Amanda Abbington,Anat Dychtwald,Raji James,Katharine Page,William Scott-Masson,Mathew Bose,Sue Kelvin,Alison King,Gresby Nash,Jack Pierce,Shaughan Seymour,Ryan Philpott,Emma Pierson,Jack Brough,Robin Kermode,Samantha Spiro,Gwenllian Davies,Ruth Lass,Eddie Allen,Alan Cowan,Susan Earl,Mark Frost,Paul Moody,Robert Purdy,Wanda Ventham,Anwen Williams,Stewart Wright,Nigel Harman,Thea Rowland,Rachel Shelley,Hannah Waddingham,Vilma Hollingbery,Saskia Mulder,Cosima Shaw,Sophie Stanton","Argentina:13,Australia:M,Finland:K-7::(DVD),Germany:12::(DVD rating),Portugal:M/12,Singapore:NC-16,United Kingdom:15::(DVD rating),United States:TV-14,United States:TV-MA::(one episode)",4,tv series

At the same time, in the French prison of Tours, Clement, a condemned murderer is about to be executed by guillotine. Under intense German bombardment, the city of Tours is heavily damaged. A few bombs fall on the prison of Tours, killing the officials and guards overseeing Clement's execution. The bombs also damage the prison walls. Clement, who survives, the bombing, sees his chance to escape. He joins one of the large columns of civilian refugees fleeing South out of the way of the invading German armies. Clement hitchhikes and is picked up by a small truck carrying French soldiers. On a main road, the truck is strafed by a German fighter plane and overturns in a ditch. Clement apparently is the only survivor and decides to steal the uniform and military identity papers of a dead French Army Sergeant. By assuming the dead man's identity, Clement becomes Sergeant Maurice Lafarge. He joins other disparaged groups of French soldiers retreating to the yet unoccupied Southern France. When they reach a small French port on the Mediterranean Sea, past Bordeaux, many French soldiers are faced with the dilemma of whether to surrender to the approaching German troops or sail away on any ship willing to take them elsewhere. Some of them intend to sail to Britain while others want to sail to French Equatorial Africa where a Free French Army is forming with the aim of continuing the fight against Germany. Clement wants to disappear but many French soldiers urge him to join them in sailing to Africa to join the ranks of the newly forming Free French Forces there. The prospects of escaping France under the guise of a French soldier, and the idea of a regular army pay, food and shelter convinces Clement to join the others on their way to Africa. During the sea crossing, they all learn that in Britain, French General Charles De Gaulle, has rallied the French troops escaping the German encirclement at Dunkirk under his banner in England. In French Equatorial Africa, Clement re-born as Sergeant Maurice LaFarge gains the respect of his comrades and superiors through his actions and leadership. While continuing to dream of running away, Clement manages to stick with his men through thin and thick and win medals and raise in rank to the rank of Lieutenant. In the dense African jungle of the interior, they clear the trees and build a landing strip for Allied warplanes. Tough work and bouts of Malaria put a heavy strain on all of them. However, for Clement, the danger of being unmasked as an impostor and a fugitive criminal is becoming more real by the day and is a bigger threat than the war. Things come to a head when the fiancée of the real Maurice Lafarge, who died in France, shows up looking for him. To make matters worse, former comrades of the real Maurice LaFarge also show up at the Free French Forces headquarters at Fort Lamy, Chad and in Brazzaville, Congo. Sooner or later some of these individuals could face Clement and unmask him as an impostor, possibly sending him in front of a court-martial for impersonating an officer or, worse, unmasking him as the murderer who escaped the guillotine in France.",6.3,"Jean Gabin,Richard Whorf,Allyn Joslyn,Ellen Drew,Peter van Eyck,Ralph Morgan,Eddie Quillan,John Qualen,Dennis Moore,Milburn Stone,John Philliber,Charles McGraw,Otho Gaines,John Forrest,Fritz Leiber,Ian Wolfe,William B.

Juliet (Keira Knightley) and Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) have just gotten married. They believe that Peter's best friend and best man Mark (Andrew Lincoln) hates Juliet, but won't say so to his or her face. Others looking at the situation from the outside believe Mark is jealous of Juliet, as he is in love with Peter. Jamie (Colin Firth), a writer, is taking a writing retreat by himself in rural France following catching his latest girlfriend (Sienna Guillory) in an indiscretion. Jamie ends up spending much time in France with Aurelia (Lúcia Moniz), the Portuguese woman hired as the housekeeper. The question becomes not only if they can communicate their day-to-day needs with each other as she speaks no English, he speaks no Portuguese, and neither speaks French very well, but communicate what seems to be their increasing mutual attraction to each other. Sarah (Laura Linney) has been in love with her co-worker Karl (Rodrigo Santoro) for the two years they have worked together, this attraction about which everyone in their workplace knows. Sarah has to decide if she can be forward enough to express this love directly to Karl, especially in light of what has been her personal priority of dealing with a family issue. Harry (Alan Rickman) and Karen (Dame Emma Thompson) have been in a stable long term marriage. His new assistant Mia (Heike Makatsch) drops hints to him that she would like them to be romantically involved. Harry has to decide whether to fall to the temptation, especially considering being married to a perceptive wife. Single and relatively young David (Hugh Grant) is the newly elected Prime Minister. At 10 Downing Street, he is attracted to one of the new household servants, Natalie (Martine McCutcheon), but isn't sure what to do about it seeing as to their respective positions, the probable public scrutiny, and an incident involving the visiting U.S. President (Billy Bob Thornton). Socially unaware Colin Frissell (Kris Marshall) believes that the lack of romantic love in his life is all the fault of standoffish British women. As such, he decides to take decisive albeit somewhat unusual geographic action. And John (Martin Freeman) and Judy (Joanna Page) are movie body doubles. They can communicate with each other straightforwardly while they are simulating sex filming a movie, but they may not be able to translate the feelings behind that simulation in real-life to each other.",7.6,"Bill Nighy,Gregor Fisher,Rory MacGregor,Colin Firth,Sienna Guillory,Liam Neeson,Emma Thompson,Lulu Popplewell,Kris Marshall,Heike Makatsch,Martin Freeman,Joanna Page,Chiwetel Ejiofor,Andrew Lincoln,Keira Knightley,Hugh Grant,Nina Sosanya,Frank Moorey,Jill Freud,Martine McCutcheon,Tim Hatwell,Laura Linney,Lynden David Hall,The Big Blue,Jont Whittington,Dan Fredenburgh,Julia Davis,Abdul Salis,Alan Barnes,Shaughan Seymour,Helen Murton,Edward Hardwicke,Caroline John,Thomas Brodie-Sangster,Gemma Aston,Matt Harvey,Adrian Preater,Joanna Thaw,Junior Simpson,Alan Rickman,Rodrigo Santoro,Brian Bovell,Sarah McDougall,Marcus Brigstocke,Richard Hawley,Wyllie Longmore,Gillian Barge,Richard Cotton,Kate Bowes Renna,Kate Glover,Nicola McRoy,Anthony McPartlin,Declan Donnelly,Elisabeth Margoni,Lúcia Moniz,Billy Bob Thornton,Peter Marinker,Keir Charles,Doraly Rosen,Meg Wynn Owen,Carol Carey,Jo Whiley,Sarah Atkinson,Clare Bennett,Sarah Holland,Vicki Murdoch,Meredith Ostrom,Katherine Poulton,Tuuli Shipster,Michael Parkinson,Michael Fitzgerald,Ciaran O'Driscoll,Rowan Atkinson,William Wadham,Catia Duarte,Igor Urdenko,Nat Udom,Ines Boughanmi,Yuk Sim Yau,John Sharian,Glenn Conroy,Ivana Milicevic,January Jones,Elisha Cuthbert,Wes Butters,Laura Rees,Emma Buckley,Sheila Allen,Terry Reece,Colin Coull,Margery Mason,Katharine Bailey,Tiffany Boysell,Georgia Flint,Joanna Bacon,Bill Moody,Billy Campbell,Paul Slack,Adam Godley,Olivia Olson,Ruby Turner,Amanda Garwood,Arturo Venegas,Claudia Schiffer,Patrick Delaney,Helder Costa,Carla Vasconcelos,Stewart Howson,Jamie Edgell,Dave Fisher,Paul Heasman,Tony Lucken,Raul Atalaia,Nancy Sorrell,Shannon Elizabeth,Denise Richards,Chevy Lamont Cofield,Richard Curtis,Frances de la Tour,Rebecca Frayn,Kelly Michelle Gray,Jeanne Moreau,Anne Reid,Fiona Thompson","Argentina:13,Australia:M,Brazil:14,Canada:14A::(Alberta/British Columbia/Manitoba/Ontario),Canada:14::(Nova Scotia),Denmark:A,Finland:K-11,France:Tous publics,Germany:6::(bw),Hong Kong:III::(DVD rating),Hong Kong:IIA,Iceland:L,India:UA,India:A,Ireland:15,Italy:T,Japan:PG-12,Malaysia:18SX,Mexico:PG-13::(DVD rating),Netherlands:AL,New Zealand:M,Norway:A::(cinema rating),Norway:11::(cinema rating),Peru:14,Philippines:R-18,Portugal:M/12,Russia:16+,Singapore:R(A),Singapore:PG::(video rating),Singapore:M18::(video rating),South Korea:15::(Asian edition),South Korea:18,Spain:A,Spain:13::(Netflix),Sweden:7,United Kingdom:15,United States:TV-14::(DLS),United States:R",NA,movie

When a strange feisty young woman named Darlene and a secretive middle-aged man calling himself Mr. Robot, who claims to be the mysterious leader of an underground hacking group known as F-Society, offer Elliot a chance to take his vigilantism to the next level and help them take down E-Corp, the corrupt multi-national financial company that Elliot works for and likes to call Evil Corp, Elliot finds himself at the crossroads. Mr. Robot, who has personal reasons for wanting to take down E-Corp, also reveals that he already has one ally, an even more mysterious, secretive and highly dangerous shadowy hacking group known only as Dark Army. Meanwhile, Elliot's childhood and only friend, Angela, who blames E-Corp for the death of their parents, tries to take down E-Corp legally by joining their ranks and trying to dig up evidence of their corruption from the inside. A wild card in this scheme becomes Tyrell Wellick, an unhinged psychopathic E-Corp yuppie, originally from Scandinavia, who has a very unusual relationship with his dominant and ambitious wife Joanna.

3751,Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,1968,all,8.6,,0,0,1,0,1,NA,"Family,Fantasy,Music",United States,English,30,NA,"""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"" was among the most famous, longest-lasting and fondly remembered children's television shows. Host Fred Rogers (known to millions as simply Mister Rogers) used his gentle charm to communicate with his audience of children. Topics centered on nearly every inconceivable matter of concern to children, ranging from everyday fears related to going to sleep, getting immunizations, and disappointment about not getting one's way, to losing a loved one to death and physical handicaps. Rogers used simple songs and, on nearly every show, segments from the Neighborhood of Make-Believe to make his point. A scale-model trolley was often (but not always) used to segue into the Make-Believe segments, said neighborhood being inhabited by puppet characters including King Friday XIII, Lady Elaine Fairchilde and Daniel Stripèd Tiger. Frequent visitors as well as Rogers' own frequent visits to various places in the neighborhood rounded out each show. The program was taped at WQED-TV in Pittsburgh; first-run shows were produced from 1968 to 1975, at which time production was suspended until 1979. New programs were taped through 2001 for broadcast alongside the original 460 episodes, the most notable coming in 1991 with Rogers's shows focusing on calming children's fears during the Persian Gulf War.",8.6,"Fred Rogers,Betty Aberlin,David Newell,Joe Negri,Robert Trow,Chuck Aber,Bill Barker,Audrey Roth,Don Brockett,François Scarborough Clemmons,Maggie Stewart,Carole Switala,Lenny Meledandri,Betty Seamans,Michael Horton,John Reardon,Johnny Costa,Elsie Neal,Hedda Sharapan,David L.

By taking on an epic journey across all of Japan from north to south, James is determined to gain a genuine understanding into why this unique land and its people are the way they are, what drives their whole culture, and what their approach to life can teach the rest of us.

Not only that, but Japan is one of the most contradictory and confusing places on earth. Here, classical art forms and haiku poetry rub shoulders with Godzilla, Cosplay, and some of the strangest obsessions on the planet, while stunning, peaceful vistas of gently falling cherry blossom give way to neon lights, J-Pop, and frenetic urban environments.

Renowned playwright J.M. Barrie (James)'s latest effort has garnered less than positive reviews, something he knew would be the case even before the play's mounting. This failure places pressure on James to write another play quickly as impresario Charles Frohman needs another to replace the failure to keep his theater viable. Out for a walk with his dog in part to let his creative juices flow, James stumbles upon the Llewelyn Davies family: recently widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (the daughter of now deceased author George L. Du Maurier) and her four adolescent sons. James and the family members become friends, largely based on he and the boys being able to foster in each other the imagination of children, James just being the biggest among them in this regard. Sylvia also welcomes James into their lives, he who becomes an important and integral part of it. Among the six of them, the only one who does not want to partake is Sylvia's third, Peter Llewelyn Davies, who is still grieving the reality of their lives, where his father was there one day planning an outing for the family, and gone the next. Two other people who don't appreciate James in the Llewelyn Davies' lives are: his wife, Mary Barrie, who always feels the need to be the responsible one in their relationship and who feels threatened by his friendship with an unmarried woman; and Emma du Maurier, Sylvia's overbearing mother, who sees him as an obstacle to Sylvia moving on with her life with another potential husband, and an impediment to maintaining discipline within the boys. James still hopes to bring Peter out of his self-imposed shell, but in the process comes up with an idea for another play based on an amalgam of himself and Peter, that play which eventually becomes what Charles sees as a largely unmountable and thus doomed production called ""Peter Pan"". This process of helping Peter could take a step backward when it looks like Sylvia may imminently befall a similar fate to that of her late husband.",7.6,"Johnny Depp,Kate Winslet,Julie Christie,Radha Mitchell,Dustin Hoffman,Freddie Highmore,Joe Prospero,Nick Roud,Luke Spill,Ian Hart,Kelly Macdonald,Mackenzie Crook,Eileen Essell,Jimmy Gardner,Oliver Fox,Angus Barnett,Toby Jones,Kate Maberly,Matt Green,Catrin Rhys,Tim Potter,Jane Booker,Paul Whitehouse,Catherine Cusack,Kali Peacock,Robert Oates,Nicholas Pritchard,Jonathan Cullen,Raymond Waring,Laura Duguid,Sevan Stephan,Rosie Ede,Richard Braine,Tobias Menzies,Murray McArthur,Charlotte Birmingham,Cora Harrison,Jack Birmingham,Sacha Janes,Chelsea Carpenter,Keeley Janes,Luciano Cusack,Stella King,Serafina Cusack,Jake Roche,Claudia Davidson,Molly Whitehouse,Noah Harrison,Sophie Whitehouse,Eden Harrison,Tony Way,Greg Bennett,Kiri Bloom,Gabriel Currington,David Decio,Ray Donn,Jade Ewen,Marc Forster,Paul Hornsby,Suzy Kewer,Jackson Payne,William Tomlin,Julz West","Argentina:Atp,Australia:PG,Brazil:Livre,Canada:G,Canada:PG::(Ontario),Chile:TE,Czech Republic:U,Denmark:A,Finland:K-7,France:Tous Public,Germany:0,Hong Kong:I,Iceland:L,India:U,Ireland:PG,Italy:T,Japan:G,Malaysia:U,Malaysia:U::(DVD),Netherlands:6,New Zealand:PG,Norway:7,Peru:Apt,Philippines:G,Portugal:M/12,Singapore:PG,South Korea:12,Spain:A,Sweden:Btl,Switzerland:7::(canton of Geneva),Switzerland:7::(canton of Vaud),Switzerland:12::(canton of Zurich),Taiwan:GP,United Kingdom:PG,United States:PG",NA,movie

He gets on well with the Captain, Anderson, an amateur botanist who grows plants in his cabin, but, due to a social gaffe, well-meaning young parson Colley falls foul of the captain, later getting drunk and having gay sex with crew members. Despite Edmund's efforts to broker an understanding he remains in his cabin, where he literally wastes away. Edmund has a sexual encounter with the comely Zenobia, travelling with her parents, but he comes to realize that they are not related at all, merely a sexual threesome. Miss Granham, travelling to take up the job of a governess, falls for the older Mr. Prettiman, whom Edmund despises as a free-thinker, though they eventually reconcile. Prettiman is badly injured in a fall and Miss Granham agrees to marry him immediately, with flowers provided by the captain, and he recovers. Wheeler, Edmund's steward, is less fortunate. He is thrown overboard as a Jonah, and, although he survives, it is all too much for him. A broken mast leaves the ship drifting dangerously towards an ice-field but the scientifically-minded Lieutenant Benet mends it in time. Arriving in Australia, Edmund's friend Lieutenant Summers is given his own ship but dies when it catches fire. Edmund is re-united with the lovely Marian, who has been travelling on another vessel, the' Alcyone,' which met up with Edmund's ship in mid-ocean and he was instantly smitten by her. He has come 'to the ends of the Earth' and, unlike several of his fellow travellers, found contentment.",7.2,"Benedict Cumberbatch,Jared Harris,Jamie Sives,Richard McCabe,Victoria Hamilton,Tim Delap,Vanessa Pike,Jonathan Slinger,Robert Hobbs,Sam Neill,Chris Walker,Denise Black,Paula Jennings,Brian Pettifer,Tom Fisher,Daniel Evans,Theo Landey,Calum Callaghan,Adam Woolf,Jonathan Pienaar,Kirsty Motzouris,Kelly Motzouris,Daniel Newman,Danelle Drury,Damon Berry,Lionel Newton,JJ Feild,Niall Macgregor,James Gracie,Joanna Page,Adrian Waldron,Charles Dance,Cheryl Campbell,Joe Vaz,David Black","Netherlands:6,United Kingdom:15",1,tv mini series

Whereas Bond's all flash, Drake (who never carries a gun, he felt them to be ""noisy, and they can hurt someone"") used his brain, instead, and is very adept at defending himself with his hands, as well. He also eschewed having the ""babe of the week"", or even having Drake involved with a woman. The show (which had initially been a half-hour series, also under the Danger Man (1960) title, and character name, but was brought back slightly ""retconned"" and became a series with hour-long episodes) became an world-wide hit, and helped propel series' lead, Patrick McGoohan to international fame (in fact, Mr. McGoohan was twice offered the role of James Bond, and twice refused. The first time, he declined, but recommended a friend of his; Sean Connery). Unlike many other spy series at this time, Danger Man was not a comedy, nor did it go off to the outlandishness of another well-known spy series of the time (The Avengers (1961)), but was able to build a long-lasting fan base by emphasising well-written scripts, terrific guest actors as well as impeccable direction, and quality production.",8.2,"Patrick McGoohan,Peter Madden,Earl Cameron,Zia Mohyeddin,John Cazabon,John Welsh,Fredric Abbott,Mike Pratt,Brian Worth,Frank Maher,Peter Brayham,Jane Merrow,Errol John,Robert Urquhart,Howard Marion-Crawford,Peter Arne,Jack Gwillim,Warren Mitchell,Aubrey Morris,Edward Underdown,Jerome Willis,Burt Kwouk,John G.

India's rich musical heritage is viewed through the prism of four specially curated instruments and vocal traditions, selected in order to represent the geographic and historic diversity of the country. The series will examine the traditions, the musicians, and the locations. Over the course of the series, the role of these historical and slowly dying instruments and musical traditions in modern Indian music cultures is re-examined and re-contextualized by A.R Rahman. The series will also focus on the beautiful craftsmanship of the instrument itself. Conversing with the instrument makers provides a view of the intricate and artistically challenging process that goes into the construction and maintenance of the instruments. A.R Rahman travels across the Indian subcontinent to meet each of the musicians and experiences their particular tradition in its original context. As the musicians live their day-to lives: practicing, performing and teaching their students they show audiences what it means to keep such traditions alive in the 21st century.",9.2,"A.R.

It revolves around the intertwined lives of the Kovac and Williams families and their network of friends and extended family. TANGLE is about two generations of two families colliding, connecting - sometimes at cross-purposes as they navigate their way around the maze of love, sex, money and politics. Tim Williams has the world at his feet. Tipped for a top job in Cabinet, he is well on his way to becoming Premier. With a happy marriage, a good relationship with his teenage son and respect from his peers, his future is looking great. There's only one little problem: 15 years ago, Tim had a brief, ill judged affair with drug-loving wild-child Nat Manning. The affair ended in pregnancy. After confessing to his wife Christine, they patched up their marriage and fought bitterly for custody of the child, Max. Nat fled to London and has barely been heard from since. Now 10 years on, Nat is a mere smear on the landscape of the Williams' hard won, happy lives. But Nat is back - and there is a secret undercurrent to the world into which she returns. Her sister, Ally, is living in domestic oblivion. Unaware that her husband, Vince, is having an affair, Ally is also blind to the fact that his best friend, Gabriel, is in love with her. She is oblivious to Vince's plans: a builder with ambition to jump into the big league, Vince can almost smell the possibility of a life of power, money and sex. If Tim Williams is going to climb the political ladder, then Vince is determined to extract his own benefits through their secret family connection. But Nat has a way of exposing what's hidden. And through it all, the teenage children of Ally and Vince, Nat, Tim and Christine, and Vince's mistress Em, are busily creating their own generation of chaos as they discover sex, danger, and the thrills of oncoming adulthood.",7.7,"Justine Clarke,Catherine McClements,Matt Day,Kat Stewart,Joel Tobeck,Blake Davis,Lincoln Younes,Eva Lazzaro,Georgia Flood,Tony Rickards,Kick Gurry,Reef Ireland,Ben Mendelsohn,Lucia Mastrantone,John Brumpton,Lucia Emmerichs,Jane Allsop,Simon Maiden,Frank Gallacher,Demmii Connolly,Madeleine Jay,Don Hany,Alicia Banit,Maude Davey,Kate Jenkinson,Dan Wyllie,Ben Schumann,Nicholas Bell,Michael Clarke-Tokely,Elena Mandalis,Steve Adams,Tim Draxl,Ryan Corr,Alison Whyte,Todd MacDonald,Fiona Harris,Drew Thornton,Tony Nikolakopoulos,Grant O'Rourke,Silas James,Caspian DezFouli,Dean Guest,Max Rosagrata,Ned Napier,Adam Zwar,Leah Vandenberg,Lliam Amor,Luke Hemsworth,Patrick Burns,Melanie Berry","Australia:MA15+::(some episodes),Australia:M::(some episodes),United States:TV-14::(self-applied)",3,tv series

They are unhappy with the non-nuclear and neutral aspirations of his party (during the Cold War) and are supported in their fears by nationalistic media moguls.

The speed with which the rhetorically gifted demagogue manages to assemble whole crowds of friends and followers around him - including above all his ""protectress"", the enigmatic Russian woman Angelika - is reflected in the speed at which he succeeds in attracting enemies from church and state. His love for the beautiful Eleonora, the daughter of a middle-class family, studying medicine at the University of Geneva - a city where Mussolini himself has been carrying stone around as an unskilled worker - even convinces him to take up studying. When a fatal accident occurs on the building-site - a worker plunges to his death from a badly-secured section of scaffolding - the young student Mussolini calls for a general strike. Arrest and expulsion are the consequences of this first piece of agitation, and it is only the intervention of his influential friend Angelika which saves him from being thrown into jail. But Mussolini is not a man to give up easily. Soon he's successful again, in Trieste, working as editor of the socialist newspaper ""L'Avventure del Lavoratore"", and a conflict soon arises between himself and the local clergy. This, however, provides the local imperial Austrian authorities with the excuse they need to expel this troublemaker and agitator from the country. Back in his native town of Forlì, Mussolini marries Rachele, his childhood sweetheart. But he's still a long way from settling down into a ""bourgeois"" lifestyle - he spends far more time with his comrades, and especially the pretty female comrades, than with Rachele and the family. It's not long before Mussolini becomes local chief of the Italian Socialist Party, in which he reveals his secure instinct for power and his talent for intrigue as he plays off various sections of the left against each other. Very soon he's levered his arch-rival Bissolati out of office: in Milan Mussolini becomes editor-in-chief of the country's largest socialist newspaper, ""Avanti!"". Mussolini exploited the escalation in violence among the country's workers for his own ends. The ""reds"" - the left-wing Socialists - and the ""yellows"" - the Republicans - were involved in a bitter war with each other. At the peak of this crisis, however, World War I broke out. While the Italian Nationalists are urging the country to take part in the war, the left wing builds its support on the pacifist strength of the ""Socialist International"": the workers of Europe must unite against the imperialist warmongers! Now that those in power represent a common enemy, Mussolini - via an adroit move - succeeds in uniting the warring left-wing factions. Although hopes that a united European left will be able to stop the war are soon dashed, Mussolini is now more powerful than ever before. It is at this period of his life that he begins to have growing doubts about neutrality and pacifism being worthy aims for a true revolutionary. Gradually he turns all his allies, even the staunchest ones, into enemies, including his beloved Angelika, by showing a lot of sympathy towards the landowning classes. The last great chapter in the history of Mussolini the socialist is now played out against the backdrop of World War I, and the transformation begins which will eventually lead him to found an entirely different type of socialism altogether - Fascismo. While the pacifists in his party are pressing for neutrality, Mussolini finally allows himself to be ""bought"" by the Conservative government. The former anti-war campaigner turned opportunist now supports the war. Now he's on his own - and at the turning-point of his political career...",5.8,"Antonio Banderas,Toni Bertorelli,Valentina Lainati,Franco Mescolini,Anna Geislerová,Raffaella Azim,Flavio Bonacci,Vitezslav Bouchner,Franco Castellano,Hana Davidona,Ladislav Gerendás,Andrea Giordana,Lidije Glavanakova,Jaroslav Heyduk,Karel Hlusicka,Jan Hrusínský,Karel Hábl,Robert Jasków,Ivan Jirík,Hugo Kaminský,Jindrich Khin,Jan Klár,Viktorie Knotková,Eduard Kolar,Claudia Koll,Magdalena Kopicova,Václav Kotva,Dan Krames,Renáta Kubisová,Rudolf Kutilek,Jan Laibl,Susanne Lothar,Steva Marsálek,Hubert Marík,Eva Matalová,Jiri Meigl,Milos Mejzlik,Pino Micol,Jirí Nemecek,Jan Novotný,Jirí Ornest,Zdenek Pechácek,Memè Perlini,Jaroslava Pokorná,Klára Pollertová,Petr Pospíchal,Jan Preucil,René Pribil,Radan Rusev,Pavel Rímský","Finland:K-12,Singapore:M18,United States:R",1,tv mini series

In the bustle and confusion, three young people forge a friendship that defies differences of social class to tackle dramas together: the German engineer Max, lucid, balanced, born to a well-to-do family, a born mediator and shy suitor to the innkeeper's daughter, Anna. The lively, cocky young woman knows all about men - and about heartache: she decided to concentrate on business instead of love... And Tommaso? The hot-headed Italian from the lower classes is deeply, passionately in love with Anna and cannot hide his feelings. Max knows that he cannot challenge Tommaso for Anna's love, and soon, the trio faces a growing tension between Tommaso, who becomes the spokesman of the miners, and Max, who struggles to be loyal to his employer and his friends.",6.5,"Silvia Busuioc,Maxim Mehmet,Pasquale Aleardi,Miriam Stein,Carlos Leal,Christoph Gaugler,Maximilian Simonischek,Walter Leonardi,Joachim Król,Marie Bäumer,Anna Schinz,Peter Jecklin,Manfred Liechti,Hanspeter Müller,Cornelius Obonya,Pierre Siegenthaler,Martin Uhlír,Roeland Wiesnekker,Peter Zumstein,Ciro de Chiara,Marcello De Nardo,James McVan,Patrick Simons,Max Tuveri,Mark Zak,Klemens Niklaus Trenkle",Germany:12,1,tv series

4548,Beat the Clock,1979,,6.7,,0,0,1,0,1,NA,"Family,Game-Show",United States,English,30,NA,"""Beat the Clock"" was one of televisions most durable game shows. Its popularity was derived from its simple format and wacky action. Two couples, preselected from the studio audience, had to complete various stunts within a time limit (usually 60 seconds or less) to win cash and prizes. Examples of the often-messy stunts (the centerpiece of the show) included blowing a plastic ship carrying a ping-pong ball from one side of a water-filled tub to the other, without allowing the ball to fall off; stuffing eight balloons in a lidded wastebasket without breaking any; and extracting three marshmallows buried in Jell-O using a spoon held in his mouth, then placing each marshmallow on a plate next to them. A huge clock counted down the seconds, as host Collyer provided commentary and encouragement. Couples who successfully completed their stunt won cash (usually $100 to $200, depending on the round) and a prize. After the first round of stunts, each couple got a chance to complete an extra-difficult ""bonus stunt"" (e.g., blowing a feather off a table and then catching it with a top hat while it was being worn) worth $100 plus $100 for each show it was not completed. During the big-money quiz-show era, the bonus prize stunt was worth $5,000 plus $1,000 for each show not completed. The format of ""Beat the Clock"" factored into countless stunt-related game shows in the years that followed; two ""Beat the Clock"" revivals also followed one in 1969 and another in 1979, both enlisting the aid of celebrity guests.",7.3,"Bud Collyer,Dolores Rosedale,Bern Bennett,John Reed King,John Jakes,Rachel Jakes,Bess Myerson,Beverly Bentley,Dirk Fredericks,Dick Noel,Bob Shepard,Bill Shipley,Henry Casso,Hal Simms,Lee Vines",United States:TV-G,1,tv series

But the bard produced some of his finest plays after the Virgin Queen's death. In this illuminating BBC series, American scholar James Shapiro examines the plays Shakespeare wrote during the turbulent reign of Elizabeth's successor, King James I. One of the new king's first official acts was to name Shakespeare a ""king's man."" Overnight, the dramatist attained security, prestige, and an up-close view of the Jacobean court. Shapiro convincingly argues that the dark, complex plays of Shakespeare's last decade--King Lear, Macbeth, and The Tempest, among others--mirrored both royal life and the era's profound social changes. Visiting sites that Shakespeare would have known, scouring archives, and consulting leading historians, literary experts, and directors, Shapiro reveals a Shakespeare we've never seen.

Hailing from Ireland and Australia, our international team of Rookies head to Coffs Harbour, on the coast of eastern Australia, and are thrown in the deep end to learn how to care for and train rescued marine animals. Their hard work culminates in the creation of a brand new dolphin and seal performance that showcases the Rookies' own conservation messages. Throughout their journey the Rookies experience the highs and lows of working with marine animals: from assisting with emergency seal, turtle and dolphin rescues and releases to witnessing the birth of a baby dolphin, to redesigning and building better animal homes to the not so glamorous job of preparing fish buckets and cleaning seal poop at 6 o'clock in the morning.

And still others begrudgingly agreed to uphold an ancient covenant, and fought against their brothers in the United States.

4684,The American Dream Project,2015,,6.8,,0,0,1,0,1,NA,Documentary,United States,English,15,NA,"The American Dream lives on in James Marshall's American Dream Project. Like the heroes of American Literature, James and his friend Todd took off cross country for the ride of their lives armed with just $250, their wits, and a healthy sense of adventure. James is an idealistic British born New Yorker who's Patriotism for America has not faltered since he first moved here 7 years ago. However, he is increasingly saddened by cynicism and the loss of hope he hears all around him. We are constantly bombarded by negative news about how bad America is, how America's future is dark and the American dream is not possible for most of it's citizens. To top it off, reality TV consistently highlights the worst of America. Combined; we are left with a self-loathing image. In this original, authentic and beautifully filmed series, we see James: an adventurous Englishman fall even deeper in love with America. And Todd, an enthusiastic American, see his own country in a whole new light. These two friends only stay with the everyday Americans they meet on the road, from the biggest city, to the smallest town, and everything in between. We hear the backgrounds and challenging stories of real Americans. We witness their views on America today and America tomorrow... what they think is right and wrong... BUT, more importantly, we learn how they are moving forward. Through the eyes of someone new to America, The American Dream Project proves that there are more good people than bad, that we have more in common than not, and that the American Spirit as well as it's Dream, is as strong as ever. To tell his story, Cole Haan partnered with Marshall's production company, Happy Marshall Productions, to bring The American Dream Project to life. James' objective was simple: reverse the negative sentiment Americans and the media are (more often than not) associating with ""America."" By using social media to connect with people, plot their course, put a roof over their heads at night and work for their keep, they were able to document and showcase that The American Dream and the optimistic spirit that built this country is very much so still alive. And now it's time to share it with the world.",6.8,"James Marshall,Todd Williams",NA,1,tv series

Even so, a small resistance force led by two revolutionaries manages to fight the oppression. With full control over the media, the government attempts to quell the nation's yearning for freedom by broadcasting a number of game shows on which convicted criminals fight for their lives. The most popular and sadistic of these programs is ""The Running Man,"" hosted by Damon Killian. When a peaceful protest of starving citizens gathers in Bakersfield, California, a police officer named Ben Richards is ordered to fire on the crowd, which he refuses to do. Subdued by the other officers, the attack is carried out, and Richards is framed for the murder of almost a hundred unarmed civilians. Following a daring jail break months later, Richards is captured once again and forced to appear on ""The Running Man"" with three other convicts. With their help, he fights his way through a cadre of sadistic gladiators hunting them down through the ruins of a Los Angeles earthquake, but promising Killian that he'll return to settle the score when the show's host double-crosses him.

To win Caesar's support from her brother, Cleopatra hides herself in a rug, which Apollodorus (Cesare Danova), her servant, presents to Caesar. The Roman is immediately infatuated. Banishing Ptolemy, he declares Cleopatra Egypt's sole ruler and takes her as his mistress. A son, Caesarion (Loris Loddi), is born of their union. Caesar, however, must return to Italy. Although he is briefly reunited with Cleopatra during a magnificent reception for the Queen in Rome, Caesar is assassinated shortly thereafter, and Cleopatra returns to Egypt. When Mark Antony (Richard Burton), Caesar's protégé, beholds Cleopatra aboard her elaborate barge at Tarsus some years later, he is smitten and becomes both her lover and military ally. Their liaison notwithstanding, Antony, to consolidate his position in Rome, marries Octavia (Jean Marsh), sister of the ambitious Octavian (Roddy McDowall). The marriage satisfies no one. Cleopatra is infuriated, and Antony, tiring of his Roman wife, returns to Egypt. There he flaunts his liaison by marrying Cleopatra in a public ceremony.

Three young friends # Richard, Peter and Andrew # set off to join the crusading army. The three friends come from very different backgrounds: Andrew is a shepherd; Peter is a poor bell founder, and the illegitimate son of a Christian woman and a Saracen man; and Richard is the deeply religious son of Baron William of Aurocastro, who was murdered by his rival brother Corrado. The violent methods used by the crusaders soon cause the three friends to fall out with each other, and after a bloody attack on a Jewish monastery, they go their separate ways: Andrew remains with the crusaders, while Peter and Richard accompany the attractive Jewess Rachel # whose teacher, a rabbi, was killed in the raid # to Jerusalem. Andrew is very reluctant to see Rachel go, having # like Peter # fallen in love with her at first sight. In Jerusalem the situation is very tense: the Saracen governor is having the Christians expelled from the city, out of fear of crusader spies. Peter, Richard and Rachel manage to trick their way into the city, but shortly afterwards Richard is arrested. When the crusaders, with Andrew at their head, arrive at the gates of Jerusalem, the former friends now face each other as enemies # because to save Richard, Peter has joined the side of the Saracens. The city cannot withstand the onslaught of the crusaders and their fierce fighting spirit, and soon falls into Christian hands. Peter prepares an escape route for himself and Richard. Rachel has decided to stay with Andrew, however, who has also confessed his love to her. Peter and Richard return to their homeland. Richard, already seriously ill, dies on arrival.

Propaganda that created and propped up a regime built on hatred and mistrust. A regime that casts a long shadow over the second half of the 20th century.

Though ""Secret"" had somewhat similar rules, there were other elements that gave the show its own distinctive flavor. As with ""Line,"" four celebrity panelists try to guess an unknown-to-them secret, which the contestant (or sometimes group of contestants) whispered in the host's ear; the secret was always shown to the television and studio audience. Each panelist has one 30-second period to ask questions that will help them try to guess the secret; if a panelist fails to guess the secret before the buzzer sounds, the contestant(s) receive(s) $20 and the next panelist gets a turn. The process repeats until either the secret is guessed or if all four panelists are unable to guess the secret, meaning the contestant receives the maximum payout of $80 (during the early years, each panelist had two questioning periods, with $10 paid per unsuccessful try). Usually, a skit or demonstration of the secret followed each story. During the final segment of the show, a celebrity guest revealed his/her own secret, each followed by a segment, in which the panelists participated. Like ""What's My Line,"" ""Secret"" had millions of faithful viewers during its CBS run, and spawned a number of revivals (including a weekly syndicated series in 1972 and a 2000 revival on the Oxygen network).

Breakdowns can be catastrophic so it's up to the skill and experience of Mega Mechanics to keep the wheels in motion, the gears turning and the hydraulics pumping. Mega Mechanics is a new 6 x 48 minute observational documentary series following some of Australia's best mechanics, fitters and engineers as they work on the biggest machines in the country. Whether it's replacing jet engines on an A330 or craning a 10 tonne jig elevator bucket out of the roof of a 5 story coal preparation plant, cutting a half a million dollar high-voltage cable or holding back a flood of more than 1.7 million megalitres of water to maintain a dam wall - the dangers are very real, the risks constant and, a mistake could be fatal. The conditions, as well as the machines, are tough; our Mega Mechanics work beside mountains of coal, or in a mining pit with temperatures soaring past 40 Degrees Celsius. Jobs take them to the highest heights and deep underground. There's machinery that has been around for more than one hundred years and then there's the latest technology leading the way. Go behind the scenes with Mega Mechanics and see what it takes to keep huge machines operational. Meet the people who must maintain these heavy metal wonders of industry, who are on the job constantly faced with challenges to overcome and who must manage extreme risks on a day to day basis.",NA,"Paul Davies,Patrick Donoghue,Steve Frost,Bryce Horne,Peter Huet,Mick Liddle,Harry Mitchell,Benjamin Noakes,Joel Oxenbridge,Trevor Sharpley,Caitlin Vlahos,Stephen Wagner,Darren Westwood",NA,1,tv series

Everywhere, from China in the east to all but a couple of countries in Europe, ancient dynasties wore their crowns in apparent security. None of that survived the next one hundred years. But change does not come in on the wind. Change proceeds from events - a political row, an assassination, a natural disaster, a human error or stroke of genius. Great changes flow from such events. The most tumultuous events of the twentieth century altered the world on a scale unprecedented in human history.

5223,Strange Curiosity,2016,,,,0,0,1,0,1,NA,"Documentary,Short",United States,English,NA,NA,"""Strange Curiosity"" is the culmination of our interest for paranormal subjects coupled with a experienced eye for production quality and cinematic storytelling. It is the canvas for us to paint the picture we see deep in our minds for not only the entertainment of the viewer, but to bring them into the story with us. Our story is a bit opposite of the norm. We started at the top--thrust right onto the worldwide scene with our show ""Ghost Lab"" on the Discovery Channel that ran for two seasons and 26-1 Hour Episodes in over 80 countries. Cancellation of the show did not cancel our desire to continue. In fact, it fueled it. Every minute of filming for a network television show taught us how to do it. We were sponges to the process. It inevitably gave us the power to create our own brand--one in which we did not have to bow to the network gods. So now we are grass roots. A band of friends taking their own time and money to film what many people call one of the best shows in its genre. But our passion to do this is not fueled by only our desire. It is perpetuated through the energy and support of our fans we made with Ghost Lab who have continued to be with us in our independent adventures with ""Strange Curiosity"". The journey from videotaping our investigations as the team Everyday Paranormal to the Discovery Channel to producing our own independent films has been a wild one, and we would like the thank our many loyal fans and supporters from around the world who have come along for the ride with us. In order to continue bringing the world new content, we are asking for small donations/subscriptions via this Patreon platform. As you know, these projects take lots of time and money, and we of all people know money is tight no matter who you are. But with a minimum two-dollar per month subscription from our fans, not only could we continue, we could become better and better. In return for our fans generosity, we will not only offer you the exclusive platform for Strange Curiosity going forward, but the longer you stay patrons, the more we will offer never-before-seen paranormal evidence, behind the scene footage, classroom experiences, virtual reality tours, discounts on merchandise AND MORE. That is why we have chosen Patreon, and we hope to see you all here very soon. This is where the party starts.

Any incorrect judgment (miscall or mistake) or a duplicate card had the overturned cards except the base card discarded and allowed the opponent a chance at his/her row of cards (no change of the base card allowed); players could ""freeze"" at any point to keep their opponent away from their cards or to gain an advantageous position. Up to four questions were played per game, with the 4th and final question called ""sudden death."" One game to complete all 5 cards calling Higher or Lower wins $100 and be the first(1st) player to win two(2) games collects $200 played the Big Money Cards; if a third (3rd) game was required, a ""Sudden Death"" round with 3 cards and a maximum of 3 questions was played. In the Big Money Cards, the champion used an initial purse of $200 to bet on a series of seven cards (positioned on a three(3) row board, with an extra $200 ($400 in 1986-1989) given after play of the third card); originally, the base card on only the first row could be changed, but this was later changed to changing the base card on each row; correct guesses earned the player their bet, while wrong guesses or a duplicate card lost the bet. Starting in October 1980, the contestant did not lose money if the exact card came up. The final card, if they didn't ""BUST"" (i.e. lost everything) on the second row was the ""Big Bet,"" where the contestant had to bet at least half(1/2) of his/her cash. Up to $28,800 was possible. Champions continued until defeated or until winning seven(7) games. The Game Play was largely similar in the 1986 CBS/syndicated revival with the following changes: 1. Questions could also involve ""educated guesses"" or general knowledge questions with numerical answers and a special 10-member polling group seated in the audience who played for the entire week. 2. In 1988, the tiebreaker game was changed to one sudden death question. 3. One card on each row in the Big Money Cards could be changed. 4. In October 1986, after the Big Money Cards (for a chance up to $32,000), players could use any jokers found in the deck to help them win a new car with the help of 7 numbered cards (1 ""CAR"" & 6 ""No"" Cards); In July 1988, this was changed to a question read about the 10-member polling group, with a player winning the car for guessing the number exactly by moving a blue diamond shaped marker to place the number from 0 to 10. The player could win an extra $500 if they were one away from the correct number. The Show changed from 7 wins to 5 wins on CBS-TV & Syndicated.",6.9,"Jim Perry,Janice Baker,Gene Wood,Lois Hamilton,Ann Pennington,Ross Martin,Meredith MacRae,Bill Daily,Vicki Lawrence,Bob Eubanks,Bill Cullen,Kristin Bjorklund,Bob Hilton,Jay Stewart,Lacey Pemberton,Suzanna Williams,Gene Rayburn,Marcia Wallace,Greg Mullavey,Jack Clark,Jim Lange,Allen Ludden,Wink Martindale,Alex Trebek,Mary Ann Mobley,Avery Schreiber,Tom Kennedy,Erin Perry,Charlie O'Donnell,Kelly Packard,Johnny Olson,Melinda Hunter,Markie Post,Jack Narz",United States:TV-G::(1996-Present),6,tv series

He finds there are certain instances where he doesn't cope well, however no less so than some others who have never been institutionalized, such as his Philadelphia Eagles obsessed father who has resorted to being a bookie to earn a living, his best friend Ronnie who quietly seethes over the control wielded by his wife Veronica, and Veronica's widowed sister, Tiffany Maxwell, a girl with problems of her own.

These creatures existed as stone during the day, but become flesh and blood at night. One Scottish clan made an alliance with humans to help protect a castle by night if the humans would protect their stone forms by day. The uneasy alliance was shattered when human prejudice provoked a betrayal that allowed the castle to be sacked and most of the resident clan destroyed, leaving only six adult survivors and a rookery of unhatched eggs. A further misunderstanding during the clan's retaliation on the invaders and rescue of their hostages left the clan frozen in stone by a magic spell that would only be broken when the ""castle rises above the clouds."" For a thousand years, the castle laid abandoned and the clan condemned by this curse. In 1994, a wealthy multibillionare named David Xanatos (Jonathan Frakes) bought the castle and transported the whole structure to Manhattan, where he placed it on top of the Eyrie building which he owned. It is high enough to be above the clouds, thus the conditions of the spell were met and the Gargoyles were revived. Now, this clan must adjust to this new age and gain friends, like Detective Elisa Maza (Salli Richardson-Whitfield), who reveals that Xanatos revived them to exploit them for his unscrupulous ends. This is coupled by the fact that another Gargoyle comrade, Demona (Marina Sirtis), is alive from their age, and is now an insane renegade bent on the extermination of humanity. Rebelling against them, the clan abandon the castle and pledge to protect New York City like they protected the castle in the past.",8.1,"Keith David,Salli Richardson-Whitfield,Jeff Bennett,Frank Welker,Edward Asner,Bill Fagerbakke,Thom Adcox-Hernandez,Jonathan Frakes,Brigitte Bako,Marina Sirtis,Kath Soucie,Thomas F.
